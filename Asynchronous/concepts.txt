Isolate : Dart is a single thread language. It executes everything in the main thread which is also
called main ISOLATE.
So to create multiple threads or isolates we need to use isolate.spawn() method.
This is not recommended because each isolate has it's own memory and thus making it very inefficient
to create multiple isolates for asynchronous calls.
To solve this we have Future and Stream which will run in the same isolate but will not block the
isolate . So any long computation if declared Future or Stream can be listened or subscribed
separately without blocking the isolate.

Event Queue : It is the queue through which events come and gets executed by the event handler.
The events are executed in a sequential manner.

Microtask Queue : It is separate queue but it has more priority than event queue.
It means the events in the micotask queue will be executed earlier than the events in event queue.



Future :
Anything that we want to achieve asynchronously we can wrap it in future. It will emit value
single time.
    await: If we want to wait for the Future task to end then we should use await. This will block the
    isolate and thus making the code synchronous.

    then: If we don't want to block the isolate then we can use then which will return the value in
    future thus not blocking the isolate.

    whenCompleted: If we want some code to execute even if success or error occurs then we should use
    whenCompleted.
    It also works asynchronously. It is like a finally block which will mandatory get executed.

    value: Will emit immediately
